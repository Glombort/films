# Films

Python script to run in terminal to choose a random movie from selected features of:
- Genre (Can choose multiple)
- Max Runtime
- Language
- Decade

The list of movies was compiled in March 2021 of what was currently on my Netflix, Amazon Prime, Kanopy watchlists

### Future of project
- Create a front-end to this (may involve changing from python to javascript
- Find way of collating the list without having to type in one by one. (May involve using TMDB's API and moving all my lists manually to there)
